# cookie_clicker_paw

to add it in a browser : open the console (CTRL + SHIFT + i) and use the command ```Game.Loader.Replace('cursor.png',src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlobIsBack/cookie_clicker_paw/refs/heads/main/cursor_paw.webp");```

to set the default image back, just reload the browser

to always have it, you can use the userscript in the repo, to install it you need an extension like [violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

the image is based on the one from [this addon](https://kayofeld.github.io/Cookie-Clicker-mod/boykisser.js)

the userscript was generated using ChatGPT, as i forgot the syntax lol
